        desc="All-wheel-drive (AWD) is a way for all four wheels of a vehicle to get power from the operating engine/motor. Generally, cars stick to front-wheel or rear-wheel drive (FWD/RWD) to save on manufacturing costs, but this comes with a lack of traction on rocky/slippery surfaces. AWD helps with that as there is more grip on the ground for the car."

        desc="The 'extended vehicle range' package typically refers to a larger fuel tank on liquid fuel/hydrogen powered cars, and a larger battery for electric cars. This package would give the driver a longer driving distance before refueling is necessary. The cost is high here because of the significant drivetrain changes that are needed."
